# How to adjust pane layout, taken from:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9812000/specify-pane-percentage-in-tmuxinator-project
#
# First set up your layout just how you like it - you can adjust widths with
# resize-pane until it is just right for you. Then run tmux list-windows. And
# then you should be able to use the layout: line from the output unaltered in
# tmuxinator.conf

windows:
  - dev:
      layout: bcc7,185x59,0,0[185x46,0,0,0,185x12,0,47{92x12,0,47,2,92x12,93,47,4}]
